# rock-mineral-prediction
hey i am Remanshu,
<br>
This project is designed to predict whether a given SONAR signal corresponds to a Rock or a Mineral
<br>
This is my learning project of machine learning.This project uses SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) data to predict whether the detected object is a rock or a mineral.
By applying data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models, the system achieves reliable classification performance.
